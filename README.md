# Summer 2024 Software Engineering Internships

📅 This board is **updated daily** using a custom automated job monitor. 

👀 For lots more positions, company tracking, recruiter contacts, and more stuff that can't all be fit in one repo, check out [Carbos (another project I'm working on)](https://carbos.vercel.app/) (it's all free!)

⚒ More companies are added and monitored every day, so feel to open a pull request with any suggestions.

📢 This project is heavily inspired by orgs like Pitt CSC so huge shoutout to them!

⭐ If you like this project and want to see it continued, I'd really appreciate a star - thanks sm!

⚠ Disclaimer: The **Opened At** date is the date that the automated job monitor discovered the job posting and may be off depending on when the company was added to the watch list.
