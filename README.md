# Summer 2024 Software Engineering Internships

This board is **updated daily** using an automated job monitor.

If you're interested in
- ⚡ More frequent monitoring of jobs (hourly, every 10 minutes, etc.)
- 🔒 Creating private lists of companies you want to monitor
- 🔌 Slack/Discord integrations for your student org
- and other cool stuff...

then please visit [my site](https://carbos.vercel.app/) (🚧 it's free and currently in construction)

The goal is to make recruiting as accessible as possible so everything is free. Of course this project is heavily inspired by orgs like Pitt CSC so huge shoutout to them!

Otherwise, please feel free to submit a pull request with any additions/changes.
